            <h2>The textual analysis done in this project provides several valuable insights into why and how the Georgia Historical Society (GHS) chose to consider Native Americans as "important" enough to Georgia's history to be included in <i>The Georgia Historical Quarterly</i> (GHQ). These insights allow for a better understanding of not only the motivations of the GHS's inclusion of Native Americans in the GHQ but also of the way that Native Americans exist in some Georgians' historical memories.</h2>

                <h3>1. <span class="red">Native American Representation in the GHQ Increased Over Time</span></h3>
                <p>The analysis performed in this project demonstrates that there has obviously been an increase in the appearance of Native Americans in the GHQ over recent years. From 1990 until the most recent year used, 2015, Native Americans have consistently appeared more than any previous year aside from the two previously mentioned outliers, 1955 and 1970. Even in 2010, which was much less than any other year in the 1990 to 2015 year span, the GHQ referenced Native Americans 85 times which was still more than every other previous year (aside from 1955 and 1970). Although it is almost impossible to say for certain why this change began to occur, it is plausible that it is just representative of the scholarly trends toward writing about more diverse groups of people. However, following Andrew Denson's line of thinking when analyzing what the rebuilding of the Cherokee capital, New Echota, showed about Georgians' historical memories of Native Americans, it could also be demonstrative of Native Americans seeming to be far enough in the past for Georgians to feel comfortable acknowledging their history.

                <h3>2. <span class="red">Cherokees are Often Written About in the GHQ in the Context of Cherokee Removal</span></h3>
                <p>Scholar Andrew Denson also argued that the building of New Echota was focused on the story of Cherokee Removal and motivated by “the moral message of atonement.”
                    <span class="d-inline-block" tabindex="0" data-mdb-toggle="tooltip" title="Andrew Denson, “Remembering Cherokee Removal in Civil Rights-Era Georgia,” Southern Cultures 14, no. 4 (2008): 85-101, 87.">

                    </span>
                    &nbsp;By focusing the story of New Echota on undoing the wrongs of their ancestors, Denson claims Southerners were able to lessen their guilt about how they treated black people that they were forced to face during the Civil Rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s. This claim could also explain how and when the GHQ mentioned Cherokees. Mentions of Cherokees in the GHQ spiked in 1950, which was not only during the relatively same time as the rebuilding of New Echota but was also in the middle of the Civil Rights Movement. As mentioned with the visualizations, a slightly closer reading of the 1950 volumes of the GHQ reveals that there was an entire article written about the <i>Cherokee Phoenix</i>. However, it is still plausible that GHS's choice to even include that article in the first place was due to achieving the sense of atonement by acknowledging a group that their ancestors had wronged that Denson claims Georgians were desperate to feel during the Civil Rights Movement.

                <h3>3. <span class="red">The GHS Includes Native Americans When They Are Central to the Story They Want to Tell</span></h3>
                <p>In her book, <i>Firsting and Lasting: Writing Indians out of Existence in New England</i>, Jean O'Brien wrote regarding the writing of local histories about New England, “Indians mattered to these [New England historical] authors because they were central to telling the story they wanted to tell.”
                    <span class="d-inline-block" tabindex="0" data-mdb-toggle="tooltip" title="Jean M. O'Brien, “Introduction: Indians Can Never Be Modern,” in Firsting and Lasting: Writing Indians out of Existence in New England (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2010), xii.">
                        <a class="footnote" href="documents/Annotated Bibliography.pdf" target="_blank"><sup style="pointer-events: none;" disabled>3</sup></a>
                    </span>
                    This same sentiment can be used to understand why about 17% of the GHQ's mentions of Native Americans are written about in context with words relating to white people and why about 61% of the years of the GHQ, words relating to white people appear in the top three words that are within five words of mentions of Native Americans. Following O'Brien's logic, the GHQ often includes Native Americans in the context of white people in the GHQ because they tend to only care about telling Native American history when Native Americans are central to the story of white people that they are interested in telling, not because they believe Native Americans themselves are important to the history of Georgia. Furthering this point is the fact that the most mentions of Native Americans in 1970 occurred two years after the signing of the Indian Civil Rights Act in 1968, which could be explained by Native Americans becoming relevant to the histories the GHS wanted to tell because Native Americans had become relevant politically.

                <h3>4. <span class="red">Final Thoughts</span></h3>
                <p>All of this goes to show that the GHQ is guilty of the same thing Claudio Saunt accused the <i>William and Mary Quarterly</i>(WMQ) of: the histories they include are determined not by answering “pertinent historical questions,” but by “the 'ethnic presence' of [the] different peoples” in the histories.
                    <span class="d-inline-block" tabindex="0" data-mdb-toggle="tooltip" title="Claudio Saunt, “Go West: Mapping Early American Historiography,” The William and Mary Quarterly 65, no. 4 (2008): 745-78, http://www.jstor.org/stable/40212024, 777.">
                        <a class="footnote" href="documents/Annotated Bibliography.pdf" target="_blank"><sup style="pointer-events: none;" disabled>4</sup></a>
                    </span>
                    &nbsp;In the WMQ, the publishers have chosen to focus almost entirely on the original thirteen British colonies instead of America as a whole, and in the GHQ, the GHS has chosen to predominantly focus on the histories of white people and ignore the majority of the histories of Native Americans who inhabited that same land.
                </p>
                <p id="last-p">Although scholars write the GHQ, its primary audience is the members of the Georgia Historical Society, who are probably predominantly Georgian. Thus, the GHS presumably chooses what articles to include in the GHQ based on what they think Georgians will enjoy and connect with. Therefore, Native Americans' presence in the GHQ is most likely representative of Georgians' popular view of Native Americans and can provide insights into Native Americans' place in Georgians' historical memories. Following this logic, Native Americans exist in Georgians' historical memories as distant “objects of the past” who are only pertinent to Georgia's present history when they are relevant politically, add to white histories, or provide Georgians with an opportunity to atone for the atrocities of their ancestors. However, by choosing to share Native American histories that's only purpose is not to advance white histories, the GHS could use the GHQ to begin rectifying the popular historical memories of Georgians and give the Native Americans of Georgia the recognition they deserve in the minds of Georgians.</p>
