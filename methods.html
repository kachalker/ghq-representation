                <p>The primary source for this project was <i>The Georgia Historical Quarterly</i> (GHQ) that has been published from 1917-2018 by the Georgia Historical Society. For this project, all volumes from every five years of the GHQ publications (1920-2015) were run through textual analysis. These volumes were downloaded from JSTOR, and you can view them <a class="link" href="https://www.jstor.org/journal/georhistquar?refreqid=browse-ui%3A63f97e819c8d9fd0519e5cf4be6329b6" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

            <p>There were a variety of other secondary sources that were referenced to guide this project including journal articles, book chapters, and websites.

            <h2 class="methods-section">Data Analysis Techniques:</h2>
            <p>I began analyzing the data by downloading every volume I needed from JSTOR, and I sorted them into folders by year. Then, I uploaded those folders to the textual analysis software, AntConc, to begin my textual analysis.</p>
            <p>I utilized 2 functions within AntConc for my analysis: KWIC and collocate. I used KWIC to find the overall times that words relating to Native Americans (Indian, native, indigenous, tribe, and the names of Georgia's 2 state-recognized tribes, Cherokee and Creek) appeared in each years' volumes of the GHQ. However, because it is impossible for a textual analysis software to tell what a word means, I had to do a slightly closer reading of where these words appeared, such as making sure “creek” related to the Creek tribe and not the body of water. I created Excel sheets with this data that you can view <a class="link" href="documents/Data Gathered Using KWIC.xlsx" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
            <p>I then used the collocate function to view all words within 5 words to the left or right of a particular word to look at words relating to Native Americans to find what context words relating to Native Americans appeared in. I specifically looked if they appeared with words indicating white people (trade, French, land, goods, colonial, White, boundary, territory, British, Spanish, settlement, European).</p>
            <p>Inspired by Andrew Denson's work about Georgians' tendency to view Cherokees only through the lens of Cherokee Removal and connect them to the Lost Cause Myth, I also used the collocate function to look for the appearance of words near the word “Cherokee” that could indicate this (sovereignty, removal, territory, lands, rights, dispossession).
                <span class="d-inline-block" tabindex="0" data-mdb-toggle="tooltip" title="Andrew Denson, “Remembering Cherokee Removal in Civil Rights-Era Georgia,” Southern Cultures 14, no. 4 (2008): 85-101.">
                 <a class="footnote" href="documents/Annotated Bibliography.pdf" target="_blank"><sup style="pointer-events: none;" disabled>1</sup></a>
                </span>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, I looked at the top three words within 5 words left or right of words relating to Native Americans and the word “Cherokee.” I recorded all of this data on Excel sheets. While recording the overall count of the words appearing near words relating to Native American and the word “Cherokee,” I combined any words that meant the same in context (e.g. trade and trader), and I only recorded the top 3 words of years that that had 3 words appearing at least 3 times and I excluded any names of authors of the GHQ and filler words (the, and, a, etc.). Also, because AntConc requires you to search singular and plural forms of a word, I created data sets for both singular and plural forms of the words I was examining. I also highlighted all lines that have data available in yellow and all words relating to white people or removal in green. You can view my Native American Context Excel sheet <a class="link" href="documents/Indian Context.xlsx" target="_blank">here</a>, and you can view my Cherokee Context Excel sheet <a class="link" href="documents/Cherokee Context.xlsx" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
